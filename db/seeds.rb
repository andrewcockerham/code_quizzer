body:
%q{
What does the following expression print to the console?

```javascript
console.log(Boolean(3 > 1));
```
},
answer:
%q{
```javascript
true
```

The number 3 is greater than the number 1, so the boolean condition returns true.  Boolean conditions are statements that return true or false.

What does the following expression print to the console?

```javascript

%q{
What does the following expression print to the console?

```javascript

%q{
```javascript
63

lala is initially assigned to 66.  lala is then reassigned to lala minus 3, or 63.  lala -= 3 is the same as lala - 3.

```javascript
lala = lala - 3; // reassigns lala to lala minus 3

What does the following code print to the console?

```javascript
var counter = 4;
counter++;

answer:
%q{
```javascript
5
```

counter is initially assigned to 4 and then reassigned to counter + 1.  counter++ is shorthand notation for counter = counter + 1.  Shorthand notation is useful for experienced programmers to complete common tasks with less typing.  Shorthand notation is difficult for new programmers because there are multiple ways of writing the same thing (and the shorthand notation is usually less clear).

answer:
%q{
5

The variable number is assigned to the value 5.  The boolean condition (number > 10) evaluates to false so the code block associated with the if statement is not executed and the number variable is not reassigned.  The number variable is still assigned to 5 when it is printed to the console.
